# 3D Disco Project Plan

This plan outlines the steps to create a 3D disco scene with a disco ball, flashing lights, and a light-up dance floor using Three.js and Vite.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Scene

- [ ] **Initialize Project:** Set up a new Vite project with a vanilla JavaScript template.
- [ ] **Install Dependencies:** Add Three.js to the project.
- [ ] **Create Basic Scene:** Implement the core Three.js components: scene, camera, and renderer.
- [ ] **Add Basic Lighting:** Introduce an ambient light to illuminate the scene.

## Phase 2: Building the Environment

- [ ] **Create the Room:** Construct the floor, walls, and ceiling to form the disco room.
- [ ] **Add a Disco Ball:** Create a sphere with a reflective or metallic material and position it in the center of the ceiling.
- [ ] **Implement the Dance Floor:** Create a grid geometry for the floor that can be manipulated later.

## Phase 3: Lighting and Animation

- [ ] **Animate Disco Ball:** Implement rotation for the disco ball.
- [ ] **Create Flashing Lights:** Add several `PointLight` or `SpotLight` sources around the room.
- [ ] **Animate Flashing Lights:** Create a script to randomly change the color and intensity of the lights.
- [ ] **Implement Light-Up Floor:** Develop a mechanism to change the colors of the dance floor grid tiles in a pattern.

## Phase 4: Realism and Refinement

- [ ] **Improve Materials:** Use Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials for more realistic surfaces (e.g., reflective floor, matte walls).
- [ ] **Add Post-Processing:** Implement effects like bloom for the lights to create a more immersive glow.
- [ ] **Implement Camera Controls:** Add orbit controls to allow the user to look around the scene.
- [ ] **Optimization:** Review the scene for performance bottlenecks and optimize where necessary.
